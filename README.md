# 3MTT Data Science Projects – Cohort 3

This repository contains my practical work from the **3MTT (Three Million Technical Talent) Program – Cohort 3**, where I am specializing in **Data Science**. The repository is a record of the projects I completed during the program’s early modules, covering Python programming, data handling, exploratory analysis, and statistics.  

## About the Program  

The 3MTT program is a Nigerian Federal Government initiative designed to train and equip a new generation of technical talent across different fields such as data science, software engineering, cybersecurity, and more.  

As a participant in **Cohort 3 (Data Science track)**, my focus has been on building strong foundations in:  

- Python programming and problem-solving  
- Working with data using Pandas and NumPy  
- Cleaning and transforming datasets  
- Visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Understanding the basics of statistics and probability  

The projects here represent the progression of my learning journey through the program.  

## Overview of Modules  

The program is structured in modules, each introducing new concepts and skills.  

- **Module 1:** Introduction to Python programming and problem-solving basics  
- **Module 2:** Deeper practice with Python through small mini-projects  
- **Module 3:** Core concepts and theory (no project submission required)  
- **Module 4:** Applied data analysis with Python, focusing on real datasets  
- **Module 5:** Statistics for data science, including descriptive statistics, probability, and hypothesis testing  

This repository includes my work for Modules 1, 2, 4, and 5.

*Note: Module 3 was mainly instructional and did not include a project submission.*  

### Module 1 – Quiz Program  
Introduced me to Python by building a multiple-choice quiz application. The program handles user input, checks answers, and calculates a score, reinforcing loops, conditionals, and data structures.  

### Module 2 – Question Mini Project  
Strengthened my understanding of logical structures in Python. This project required combining control flow and functions to solve structured problems in an interactive way.  

### Module 4 – Sales Data Analysis  
Applied Python to a real-world dataset. I performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover sales patterns and trends. This was my first experience with exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

### Module 5 – Statistics  
Focused on applying statistics to data science problems. I calculated descriptive measures, worked with probability distributions, and practiced hypothesis testing to support data-driven insights.  

## Tools and Technologies  

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Development Environments:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub  

## Goals of This Repository  

- To demonstrate the skills and knowledge I am building during the 3MTT program  
- To track my learning progress in a structured way  
- To share my work publicly and connect with others in the data science community  

## About Me  

My name is **Emmanuel Obiorah**, and I am a trainee in the 3MTT Cohort 3 program, specializing in Data Science. I am passionate about learning how to use data to solve problems and make better decisions. Through this program, I am building a foundation in Python programming, data analysis, and statistics, with the aim of progressing into machine learning and advanced analytics.  

## How to Use This Repository  

1. Each module has its own folder with the notebook(s) for that project.  
2. You can open `.ipynb` files directly in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
3. Review the code, outputs, and visualizations for each project.  
4. Clone or fork the repository if you want to run the projects yourself or adapt them for practice.
